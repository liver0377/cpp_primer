Pika is a persistent huge storage service , compatible with the vast majority of redis interfaces (details),
including string, hash, list, zset, set and management interfaces. With the huge amount of data stored,
redis may suffer for a capacity bottleneck, and pika was born for solving it. Except huge storage capacity, 
pika also support master-slave mode by slaveof command, including full and partial synchronization. You can 
also use pika together with twemproxy or codis(pika has supported data migration in codisï¼Œthanks left2right and fancy-rabbit)
